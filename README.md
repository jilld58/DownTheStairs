# DownTheStairs
This is an application for a real-time detuning delay effect.

"ViewController.swift" is the main code for this project.

In order to run this application, download the zip file and open "finaldownthestairs.xcodeproj"

In the menu bar, select "Product --> Run" or select the "Build and Run Current Scheme" button (looks like a play button) to build project. 

In the simulator, there are sliders/controls for:
1. Speed of LFO
2. Depth of LFO
3. Feedback
4. Main Volume
5. Effect Volume

The "DownTheStairs.pd" file is the Pure Data patch for the effect.
